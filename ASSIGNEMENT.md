Welcome to Sentia Recruitment

The purpose of this repository is to provide an assignment that will highlight the strengths required by a kubernetes consultant in our kubernetes consultancy workforce.

## General Information

This assignment is meant to challenge the potential applicant in the complete spectrum of designing a solution and delivering an environment in a Kubernetes environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Please be aware of the fact that we are not only looking at the actual deliverables but also the process followed to achieve these results. *The presentation of the results is of equal importance to the actual results.*

You will need to make a choice of delivering your solution in either **Amazon EKS**, **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)** or in your **local kubernetes cluster**.

## Before You Start

The assessment aims to mimic a day-to-day scenario that you will be in constant contact.
Therefore, the assessment is focused to provide visibility over your skills regarding Kubernetes and manipulating applications within it, not developing applications.

We would like to see your decisions and thoughts. For this reason, no "already existent" environment is provided.
The ability to transform a request into a solution is valuable and we would like to see this from you.

Each one of us has different backgrounds and skills. Having this in mind, the below section aims to explain a little bit more about what is not needed by you, but can be done if you would like to.

### You DO NOT NEED TO:
* Develop application code (scripts to run within cronjob) -> Instead, you can rely on a dummy linux image.
* Develop application code (NodeJS) -> Instead, you can use a blank NodeJS image.
* Develop application code (API) -> Instead, you can use a dummy webserver image.

You do not have the responsibility of developing application code.
However, the images used within the pods must offer the functionalities. 
**Example:**
API pod -> web-server image based (offer web server functionality -> http ports).

## Assignment

### Transformation and Migration to MicroServices

You have participated in a meeting with a client to assess their strategy to migrate their application to MicroServiced approach. They are currently hosting a customer facing web application on their on premise environment based on a NodeJS application behind an NGINX reverse proxy. They are utilizing a MongoDB cluster for storing data as well as an FTP server for their web pages files/code. They also maintain a cron server, mostly Bash and Python scripts, relevant to a small amount of jobs that needs to be executed a few times per day (no more than once per hour). Additionally, the client is developing a brand new API, and would like to host it on the new setup.
All the above services are hosted on several virtual machines at the client's OnPremises datacenter.

Finally, the customer currently has 2 environments, namely Development (DEV) and Test (TST).

The customer is interested in migrating the complete environment to a MicroServiced approach. They are not in a hurry, and they have given an indication that they want to go live on a Kubernetes setup 12 months after they have agreed on the vendor to support them in this journey. They want to make sure that they have enough time to adjust the application to any technology related changes originating from an infrastructure perspective.

#### Isolation

Only the NodeJS application and the API are allowed to access the MongoDB instance.

The cronjob must access only the API application.

The client also asked as a must the configuration of an account within kubernetes that has permissions to read pods and delete services only within the mongodb perimeter. The access to use this account must be noted in your evaluation document.

#### Remarks

There is a soft requirement for exporting all application and infrastructure logs to an ElasticSearch Cluster. The customer needs to have access to the Kibana dashboard within their headquarters but the cluster/dashboard *should not* be publicly accessible.

Another soft requirement is having the API application running on 1, and only 1, specific machine of the cluster.

The API application must answer on the same url as the nodejs application.

There is a bug in the client's NodeJS application that expects a file being created at /opt/node_reporting_bug/gambiarra.md before the NodeJS application starts. The file must contain the value ("The greatest teacher") of a secret (node-gambi) and the phrase "failure is." in order to the NodeJS app to start.

It is expected an increased number of external accesses when the application goes live.

### Your Role

You have undertaken the task to design the future state of this environment in a kubernetes platform.
The solution needs to:
* (must) be scalable and flexible.
* (must) utilize managed services only if kubernetes cannot offer or depends on.
* (must) persist data.
* (must) workaround the NodeJS major bug in an automated way.
* (nice to have) be modernized during this migration in terms of infrastructure technologies used.

Cost optimization should be applied when necessary, even if a few application related modifications are necessary. Environment isolation is important, but some shared services would be acceptable if they result in major cost reduction.

## Deliverables

Please provide the following:
1. An architectural design for all the components and all the environments.
2. An IaC project for deploying an MVP demo.
    * for Kubernetes, write your IaC using: **YAML** and/or **Automated KubeCTL command scripts**
    * for AWS, write your IaC using: **AWS CDK** (preferred), or alternatively with AWS CloudFormation.
    * for Azure, write your IaC using: **Bicep** (preferred), or alternatively with ARM Templates.
3. Include a simple time log of the activities you have performed.
4. Document any assumptions and decisions you have made.
5. A GIT repo with all the above.
